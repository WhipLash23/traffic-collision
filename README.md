# ðŸš— Predicting Fatality of Traffic Collisions
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict the fatality of traffic collisions using data from the Toronto Police Department. By analyzing various features related to traffic accidents, the model helps identify high-risk scenarios and supports data-driven policy and safety decisions.


## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives
- Analyze Toronto collision data to uncover patterns and key fatality factors

- Clean and preprocess raw datasets for model training

- Apply supervised machine learning to predict fatality outcomes

- Provide actionable insights to improve public safety measures
